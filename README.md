# Personal Performance Analytics

> Using machine learning to understand how sleep quality, time usage, and lifestyle factors affect my daily performance and spending behavior.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes personal health and behavioral data to uncover patterns and build predictive models that answer:
- What factors most significantly impact my sleep quality?
- How does poor sleep affect my spending habits and decision-making?
- Can I predict high-spending days or poor sleep nights based on daily behaviors?
- What lifestyle optimizations would improve both my sleep and financial discipline?

**Current Status:**

## Data Sources

**Automated Tracking:**
- **Oura Ring**: Sleep stages, HRV, resting heart rate, readiness scores, activity metrics
- **Timelines App**: Time allocation across work, study, gaming, and other activities

**Manual Daily Logs:**
- Caffeine intake (amount and timing)
- Screen time before bed
- Stress levels (1-10 scale)
- Daily spending and purchase categories
- Impulse purchase flags

**Target Data Range:** 6+ months of historical Oura data + 4 weeks of comprehensive lifestyle tracking

## Research Questions

### Sleep Analysis
- Which lifestyle factors (caffeine timing, screen time, stress, activity) most impact sleep quality?
- How do work/study hours affect sleep recovery metrics?
- Can tomorrow's sleep quality be predicted based on today's behaviors?

### Spending Behavior Analysis
- What triggers high-spending days vs. low-spending days?
- Are impulse purchases more common on days with bad recovery metrics?
